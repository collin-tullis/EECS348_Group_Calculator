Team Meeting 12.06
WHEN: Wednesday, December 6th @ 6:00 pm
PURPOSE: Ninth team meeting, finishing implementation?
ATTENDANCE: (virtually) Gavin Billinger, Lydia Peng, Adira Mongar, Collin Tullis, Ethan Gao

The team worked on conglomerating all our various program files into a workable software. 
Once we got it together, we started testing numerous different test cases. 
There were a few bugs we had to work out, but it helped with putting together our test case document.

After a few hours of working, we nearly have a complete implementation, but there’s still work to be done. We’ll meet up end of the weekend.
