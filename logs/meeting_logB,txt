Team Meeting 12.08
WHEN: Sunday, December 8th @ 4:00 pm
PURPOSE: Tenth team meeting, more bug fixing
ATTENDANCE: (virtually) Gavin Billinger, Adira Mongar, Collin Tullis, Ethan Gao, Lydia Peng

We have met once again to test and fix all the bugs in our implementation. 
There seemed to be trouble with the way parenthesis are parsed, but we were able to fix it.

We went through our list of test cases, marking down any initial failures, and then we fixed all the problems that arose. 
By the end of the meeting, we had a well-functioning program and most of the test document was complete. 
We will meet up again the day before everything is due to go over all deliverables.
