Team Meeting 11.6
WHEN: Wednesday, November 6th @ 6:00 pm
PURPOSE: Sixth team meeting, finalizing Software Architecture document.
ATTENDANCE: (virtually) Gavin Billinger, Collin Tullis, Adira Mongar, Lydia Peng, Ethan Gao

Matthew was absent, but he had his assigned section completed.
We met up to discuss the final parts of the document that needed work. 
Section 4 and 6 still needed work so we went and brushed up those sections. 
We nearly finished the document, all that was left by the end of the meeting was some picture/model inserts. 
Otherwise, Part 3 was essentially completed.
