Team Meeting 12.04
WHEN: Wednesday, December 4th @ 6:00 pm
PURPOSE: Eighth team meeting, synching implementation
ATTENDANCE: (virtually) Gavin Billinger, Lydia Peng, Adira Mongar, Collin Tullis, Ethan Gao, Matthew Eaglemen

We got together to discuss what needs to be completed with implementation. We have a nearly working Lexer, Parser, Error Handler, and the remaining parts are almost finished. 
Ethan and Collin have taken it upon themselves to get a working exe together and we’ll re-adjourn on Friday to see what we have then—maybe get to work on some test cases.
