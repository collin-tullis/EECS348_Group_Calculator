Team Meeting 11.13
WHEN: Wednesday, November 13th @ 6:00 pm
PURPOSE: Seventh team meeting, starting implementation
ATTENDANCE: (virtually) Gavin Billinger. Lydia Peng, Adira Mongar

Collin, Ethan, and Matthew were absent from today’s meeting. Collin told us beforehand he wasn’t going to be able to make it.

Today, we just went over implementation assignments. Each person was assigned a module and we’ll meet up once more before the deadline to ensure we have a prototype.

The parts were assigned as follows (though they are subject to change):

Lexer: Gavin
Parser: Ethan/Collin
Evaluator: Lydia
Display/UI: Matthew
Error Handler: Adira
